# Stroke Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of stroke in individuals based on demographic and health data. Early prediction can help in preventive healthcare measures and timely interventions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and PR Curve.

## Requirements
- **Python**: v3.7 or higher
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn,
